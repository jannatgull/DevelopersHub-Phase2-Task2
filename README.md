## Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

**Objective:**  
Cluster customers based on spending habits to design personalized marketing strategies for each segment.

**Dataset:**  
Mall Customers Dataset – contains customer demographic information and spending scores.

**Instructions / Approach:**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze customer demographics and spending patterns.  
   - Visualize distributions, outliers, and correlations.

2. **Apply K-Means Clustering**  
   - Segment customers into clusters based on spending behavior.  
   - Determine optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score**.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization**  
   - Use **PCA** or **t-SNE** to reduce dimensions.  
   - Visualize clusters in 2D or 3D for better interpretability.

4. **Propose Marketing Strategies**  
   - Identify characteristics of each cluster (e.g., high spenders, budget-conscious customers).  
   - Suggest targeted campaigns, loyalty programs, or personalized offers for each segment.

**Skills Gained:**  
- Unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)  
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)  
- Customer segmentation and profiling  
- Strategy development based on data insights
